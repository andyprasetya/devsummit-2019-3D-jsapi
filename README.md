# Dev Summit 2019 Presentations

Presentations for the 3D JavaScript API at the 2019 ESRI Developer Summit

## Interactive 3D Maps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

Discover the 3D capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and learn how to leverage them to build stunning 3D web applications. This session will focus on the fundamental 3D building blocks of the API: SceneView, 2D and 3D layers, terrain, and symbology.

## 3D with WebGL in ArcGIS

ArcGIS contains a rich set of experiences for delivering 3D web applications with WebGL from the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to the Scene Viewer, Web AppBuilder, and configurable Templates. ArcGIS JavaScript capabilities use WebGL to render 3D in the browser with no plug-ins. This session will provide a brief overview of the capabilities and relationships of Esri's JavaScript 3D offerings along with demos and tips showing what can be done with web-based 3D apps. Presenters will also touch on technologies such as Scene Layers, mobile apps, and how they relate to JavaScript experiences.
